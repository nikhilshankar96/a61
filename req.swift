//This assignment will consist of enhancing the application that you worked on in assignment #5 by adding a User Interface as follows:
//-    The application should be an iOS application that has at least one view.
//-    Add a text field for each of the parameters that need to be entered by the user
//-    Add buttons to the view – One for each command
//-    To view all suppliers, add a new view with a text area (UITextView) to display the list of suppliers instead of using the console.
//-    Do the same to show the list of timings available to be booked.
//-    The views for the supplier and timing lists should have a close button to bring you back to the main view.
//-    Add alerts whenever applicable ( such as when a required field is missing, or when invalid data is entered etc …
//-    Reuse the same back-end classes that were developed for the previous assignment
//-    Do not use ViewControllers or IB to build your interface. Use code as described in the class.
//-
//- I have attached an already created empty app project. You can use it as your starting project.
